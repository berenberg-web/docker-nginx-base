# /cache/nginx/proxy is the place where the actual cache stored. Inside the folder, cache file was binary file but you can easily spot the html tag inside it.
# levels=1:2 is levels parameter sets the number of subdirectory levels in cache.
# keys_zone=STATIC:8m was defining shared memory zone named WEB_WEBSITE with maximum size 20 MB. It holds all active keys and metadata of the cache. So, whenever nginx checks if a page was cached, it consults the shared memory zone first, then seek the location of actual cache in /cache/nginx/proxy if cache exist.
# max_size was maximum size of cache e.g. files size on /cache/nginx/proxy.
# inactive=1h specify maximum inactive time cache can be stored. Cached data that are not accessed during the time specified by the inactive parameter get removed from the cache regardless of their freshness.
